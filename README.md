1) No I would not use a unit test for "messaging" this is because it's too broad to have any meaningful unit tests. Unit tests should be smaller features and isolated logic, the messaging feature combines multiple features and aspects of the app that should be individually unit tested.
2) Yes I would use a unit test for max character message. This is a section of isolated logic that can be tested very simply, additionally it is similar to a small input edge case.
